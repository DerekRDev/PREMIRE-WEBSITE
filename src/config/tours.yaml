  # When adding new tours, make sure to:
  # 1. Create a corresponding TypeScript workflow file in src/core/ai/workflows/tours/
  # 2. Define the conversation flow and choices in TypeScript
  # 3. Define the UI highlighting elements here in YAML
  # 4. Ensure the step IDs match between the two implementations
